# Tik Tok as a Complicated Public: Navigating the Self Amidst the Tumultuous Digital Space
### This paper was completed in Dr. Amelia Acker's seminar course "Critial Data Studies," fall 2019

#### Introduction

In fall 2019, amid the rise of the social media app Tik Tok—a relaunch and revision of
the app musical.ly—a certain trend began to present itself in this new digital space (Hermann
2019). This trend, known as “Dancing to Voicemails from my Ex” (2019) features women
(mostly teenagers and those in their 20s) dancing to voicemails from often abusive former
partners. Because of the audio adaptability of Tik Tok, when these users record a video, unique
audio data is attached to the video, which is called a “sound” on the app. Each video generates a
clickable label that is then attributed as provenance to the original user of that sound. In the case 
of this trend, which became a meme, the audio circulating on the app were voicemails of the ex-
boyfriends of the posters. When clicked, this linked sound will bring up the original video (marked as original in the app), along with any additional videos that have reused that sound. 

I’m interested in the way this particular way of linking of sound data furthers a certain sort of public
culture around a meme. On one hand, this allows a way of using and interacting within a digital
space in order to facilitate a certain self-empowerment. On the other hand, this interaction can
lead to a certain surveillance of the individual posting the sound and video, and the individual (in
this case, the ex-boyfriend) recorded in the voicemail, due to the rapid circulation and attribution
of sound data on the Tik Tok platform, made possible by a capitalistic, surveillance culture.

In this paper, I’ll consider the particular circulation of sound data on Tik Tok, thinking of
these memes on Tik Tok as constitutive of a data public, and applying this methodology to the
“Dancing to Voicemails from my Ex” meme. I’ll first relay some pertinent history of Tik Tok
and it’s capitalistic, surveillance-culture foundations. I’ll then discuss the way Tik Tok
complicates circulation, and how trends on Tik Tok quickly become memes that are repeated and
modified again and again by users. Such memes often trace provenance to a particular sound.
These sound-led memes constitute a kind of public, where both empowerment and risk happen,
and where a complicated human-digital interaction materializes, which contributes to the idea of
a networked self. I’ll discuss how these interactions are further complicated by the algorithmic
discovery process on Tik Tok, which creates an illusive public, with a hidden circulation
potential.
