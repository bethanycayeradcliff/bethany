### Summary

Orchard House, the home-turned-house-museum of famed *Little Women* author, Louisa
May Alcott, sits in the quiet Boston suburb of Concord, Massachusetts. The Alcott family moved
to this home in 1858, when Alcott was 25. It was in this home that Alcott penned *Little Women*,
and where her family resided for 18 years. Likely, the home’s notoriety has risen due to that fact,
that *Little Women* was indeed (at least partially) written there, at the desk in Alcott’s bedroom
that is still on view. The house itself, known now in its museum iteration as “Louisa May
Alcott’s Orchard House,” was a place that Alcott used as a jumping off point for various
adventures. Though the family lived there for 18 years, during that time, Alcott’s own
association with the home was somewhat fleeting. Alcott was not one to keep still for long unless
she had a project going or poor health, and she was a traveler, a suffragist, an abolitionist, and a
Civil War army nurse, to name a few associations which required her to jettison from the home.
This was a somewhat tricky situation at the height of the Victorian cult of domesticity, when a
woman’s place was commonly seen as being attached to housework, as the “celebration of the
domestic hearth,” relegated women to “housebound activities” (Sánchez-Eppler 345). Alcott
could often be found navigating the divide between what were deemed her womanly domestic
duties, and her professional and personal interests. Even today, the challenge of a house museum
that focuses on a woman is that domestic connotations can often imprison the protagonist in her
physical home.

Who better to argue for a change in the narrative of her house museum than the author
herself? My goal in this analysis is to show that Alcott was less attached to her physical home
than is often assumed due to the domestic associations of *Little Women*. Further, looking at
Alcott’s novels, *Work* and *Shawl-Straps*, which value movement from the physical home, the
author herself is calling for her own placement outside of the home. This same ideology is seen
through Alcott’s roles in the suffrage movement, abolitionist movement, as a Civil War nurse,
and as a traveler. Though writing put her behind her desk at home, it also paid the bills. While
her duty as sister, daughter, and adoptive mother often kept her home as a caretaker and
housekeeper, Alcott was still involved in progressive movements. Looking at these truths, I’ll
end with a proposed exhibition for Orchard House, curated with a focus on Alcott’s life away
from the home, but connected to the home, as Alcott always was. My goal here is not to berate
Orchard House and its role as a house museum, but to suggest a feminist narrative reformation in
order to increase and bring into focus an awareness of Alcott’s less domestic life, in which there
are some considerations that can be taken into account in order to present the fullest picture of
the multifaceted Louisa May Alcott.
