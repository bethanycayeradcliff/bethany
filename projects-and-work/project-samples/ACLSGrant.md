### This fake ACLS grant was written for Dr. Tanya Clement's Digital Humanities course

**Grant Abastract:**

Metadata for Networked Archival Connection (MNAC) will create a set of linked data standards
of relational connections designed to function as a network within the digital space of an archive.
With SNAC and WikiData, MNAC will create an internal digital network for archival
collections. MNAC will include use cases: (1) a network that visualizes the Diane Johnson
Collection at the Harry Ransom Center, connecting it to and visualizing the Sylvia Plath
collection at Smith College Special Collections and (2) a visualization of the connections within
the Smith Collectionsâ€™ Ms. magazine papers and the Voices of Feminism Oral History Project,
and (3) documentation and an implementation plan with an online training course, to allow
institutions to implement this network into their collections.
