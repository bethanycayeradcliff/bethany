### Abstract
On April 9, 2019, Facebook released a new memorialization feature for postmortem user
profiles: the Tributes page. This page is part of the postmortem profile, located on a tab, as to be
distinct from the now-dead user’s original Timeline. Such features related to death and dying
complicate death and mourning practices in a digital age where in-real-life practices are increasingly
becoming platform activities. This isn’t necessarily a new thing, as the notion of becoming
platformed, on social networking sites in particular, has been evolving over time as social media has
played a role in augmenting reality and affecting what it means to be and participate in the world. I
suggest that the power platforms have over postmortem practices can be confirmed and better
understood when traced through the lens of rhetorical memory theory, which posits memory as
contingent on both remembering and forgetting (Stormer 2013). Looking at the press material of
Facebook’s new Tributes feature alongside this understanding of memory, as well as Haraway’s idea
of “technobiopower,” raises issues of user agency, and elucidates the omniscient, blackboxed power
inherent in such platform features (Haraway 1997). This analysis of Facebook’s Tributes with
rhetorical memory and posthumanist theory reveals the platform’s power in augmenting social
practices, and hence, memory formation in regard to postmortem profiles.
