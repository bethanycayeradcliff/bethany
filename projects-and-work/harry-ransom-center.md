# Harry Ransom Center

### Since fall of 2019, I have been a graduate research associate at the Harry Ransom Center. I work in Reference & Research Services, where I have gained experience in public services, research for patrons, primary source pedagogy, digital access and stewardship work, and grant writing.  

#### Public Services Experience
- I complete offsite patron requests for archival materials and work to communicate with patrons to help them access the materials they need
- Before COVID-19, I worked shifts at the reception desk and at the reading room reference desk
- I work to educate patrons in archival practices by completing in-person introductions to our resources

#### Special Events, Exhibits, and Teaching
- Co-curated Black History Month: Discovery and Possibility, a one-day exhibit that took place in February 2020
- Co-curated and presented a four-part book club event for the book *The Things They Carried* by Tim O'Brien, which included an archival presentation and book club discussions
- Taught primary source archival education classes on various topics related to materials held at the Ransom Center

#### Digital Access and Stewardship
- Worked on the Mel Gussow Interview Recordings Collection, enriching metadata and uploading media objects to CONTENTdm
- Enriched metadata for 30+ recordings in the Anne Sexton Audio Recordings Collection

#### Other Activities
- Worked on patron privacy policy committee to create a privacy policy for use at the Ransom Center
- Participated in writing a grant proposal focused on AI, collectons-as-data, and digital collection use
