# AudiAnnotate 

## Since September 2019, I have worked on the AudiAnnotate project as a graduate research assistant.
### Information about the AudiAnnotate project can be found [here](https://hipstas.org/audiannotate/). In brief, AudiAnnotate exists to further the study of and access to archival audio, through [an application](http://audiannotate.brumfieldlabs.com/) that allows for the association of annotations on audio with the audio media itself. This uses the IIIF framework and is stored in a user's own GitHub project repository. 

#### Notable work I have done for the AudiAnnotate project includes: 

- Completing workshops to share workdlows and information about AudiAnnotate
- Creating documentation and videos to assist with access
- Researching audio annotation tools to contribute to our workflow
- Contribute feedback and interface changes
- Build documentation in GitHub Pages
- Present at conferences, including DH2020 Conference, Texas Conference on Digital Libraries, and the LD4 Conference
- Writing reports of grant progress and project status
- Researching and writing educational lesson plans for bringing audio annotation practices to the classroom
