			A note on this exhibit:
		</h3>
			<p>I chose the theme of issues of incarceration in the southern United States. It was a challenge to find digitized materials related to these topics. I initially endeavored to use only materials related to Texas itself, but broadened that to include materials in the southern United States, though most resources have Texas connections. These materials span in time from 1840 to the civil rights era, to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time, but are ongoing in temporality.
			</p>

			<p>The items below are from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, Sam Houston State University, the Texas After Violence Project, which is part of the University of Texas at Austin Libraries, and Stephen F. Austin State University. I have included two oral histories from the Texas After Violence Project, to think critically about wrongful imprisonment, lack of fair trial, the impact of imprisonment on formerly incarcerated people, as well as the affect of imprisonment and the death penalty on survivors. The newspaper clipping from Stephen F. Austin's Texas Runaway Slave Project beckons a critical focus on the racist history of policing and arrest. The audio recording on "criminal syndicalism" from the Harry Ransom Center spotlights the creation of false crimes and the wrongful arrest of black Americans. The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State University creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration, as well as the spectacle and interest in prisons due to the fact that handheld stereoscopes themselves were tied to entertainment value. This exhibit is limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for those interested in exploring the complexities surrounding incarceration, that have existed for many years, and persist today.

			 <br>

			<b>Significance to this exhibit:</b><br>
			<br>
			 In this recording, Beecher and members of the Council of Federated Organizations meet with the arrested high school students to discuss the way the charge of "criminal syndicalism" with a $1000 bond was used as a fear tactic to divide the black community in McComb, Mississippi. The first speaker in the recording talks about how "syndicalism" was a contrived charge created in order to arrest an innocent individual. The second speaker, Dennis Sweeney (a white activist) mentions that he was arrested and out of jail in one day and was released without bail, while the black high school students were in jail for a month and had to be bailed out. The third speaker asks about conditions in the prison, and the parents who are present at the discussion talk about the difficulties and restrictions around visiting their arrested children. The arrested students also discuss their experiences. Topics of this recording relate to the affect of imprisonment, wrongful charge and arrest, affect of arrest on friends and family, and the disproportionate impact of arrest on black americans.

			<a href="https://digital.library.shsu.edu/digital/collection/p243coll3/id/5607">2. Stereoscope of front entrance to the Penitentiary</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Collecting Institution:</b> Sam Houston State University<br>
			<br>

			<b>Item Date:</b>1873-1875<br>
			<br>

			<b>Original Format:</b>stereoscopic photograph<br>
			<br>

			<b>Digital Format:</b>jpeg<br>
			<br>

			<b>Description from Institution:</b><br>
			<br>
			 Stereoscope view of the front entrance to the Texas State Penitentiary before the high wall was built to surround the entire prison property. The large three-story building to the left was erected by Ward, Dewey & Company, lessees, when they took charge. After this building burned, the lot was cleared of debris and the street moved from its then location to sixty or seventy feet further west (over the site of the Superintendent's home, which also was destroyed by the fire). The wall now surrounding the prison was located far enough West to replace what was formerly the street behind and inside the prison walls. That necessitated moving in the entrance gate shown in the photograph to its present location. Before this entrance gate was placed across the street, public passage was open all the way through to the city limits on the east side of town. Ward, Dewey & Co. probably erected the entrance gate and closed the street when they came to Huntsville to operate the Penitentiary.<br>

			<b>Significance to this exhibit:</b><br>
			<br>
			 The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State University creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration. Handheld steroscopes were popular tools for entertainment in the mid-to-late 1800s and provided intricate and immersive images, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/sterographs-original-virtual-reality-180964771/">much like present-day virtual reality</a>. Thinking of this history of stereoscopic media can present a way of thinking through the prison and it's infrastructure as having an entertainment value, which perhaps contributes to the view of the prisoner as less-than. The focus on the architecture of the prison itself creates a space for thinking about structures of power, and the way the building is presenting in a particular way. The item description also discusses the building of a fence around the prison, further closing the prison away from society.
