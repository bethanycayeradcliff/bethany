:honeybee: Hello! My name is Bethany Radlciff and I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Information and Department of English. I  will graduate in 2021 with a an M.S. in Information Studies and an M.A. in English, with a concentration in Digital Studies. 

:books: As a student at the University of Texas, I have had the opportunity to follow my interests in an array of research that all has to do with thinking critically about representations of information. I have been most interested in thinking about archival representations of creatorship through cataloging practices and descriptive metadata, representations of sound metadata on Tik Tok, the way literary house museums share a particular narrative about the creator they represent, and even the way social media platforms, like Facebook, represent and memorialize death through certain features. I like to think about how infrastructures that collect and make accessible data, like archival institutions and libraries, but also platforms, are upholding a particular representation and interpretation of idenities through the metadata and data that structure and support such systems of access. 

:computer: I have had the opportunity to gain valuable work experience at UT. I currently work as a graduate research assistant at the Harry Ransom Center in public services and digital projects. I also work as a graduate research assistant on the [AudiAnnotate](http://audiannotate.brumfieldlabs.com/) project with Dr. Tanya Clement and Brumfield Labs, and as an affiliated researcher in Dr. Amelia Acker's [Critical Data Studies Lab](https://data.ischool.utexas.edu/) at the School of Information.
