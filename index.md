### About Me
***

Hello, my name is Bethany Radlciff and I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Information and Department of English. I will graduate in 2021 with a an MS in Information Studies and an MA in English, with a concentration in Digital Studies. 

At the University of Texas, I have had the opportunity to follow my interests in an array of research that all has to do with thinking critically about representations of information. I have been most interested in thinking about archival representations of creatorship, representations of sound metadata on Tik Tok, the way literay house museums share a particular narrative about the literary creator they represent, and even the way social media platforms, like Facebook, represent and memorialize death through certain features.
