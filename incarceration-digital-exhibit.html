			A note on this exhibit:
		</h3>
			<p>I chose the theme of issues of incarceration in the southern United States. It was a challenge to find digitized materials related to these topics. I initially endeavored to use only materials related to Texas itself, but broadened that to include materials in the southern United States, though most resources have Texas connections. These materials span in time from 1840 to the civil rights era, to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time, but are ongoing in temporality.
			</p>

			<p>The items below are from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, Sam Houston State University, the Texas After Violence Project, which is part of the University of Texas at Austin Libraries, and Stephen F. Austin State University. I have included two oral histories from the Texas After Violence Project, to think critically about wrongful imprisonment, lack of fair trial, the impact of imprisonment on formerly incarcerated people, as well as the affect of imprisonment and the death penalty on survivors. The newspaper clipping from Stephen F. Austin's Texas Runaway Slave Project beckons a critical focus on the racist history of policing and arrest. The audio recording on "criminal syndicalism" from the Harry Ransom Center spotlights the creation of false crimes and the wrongful arrest of black Americans. The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State University creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration, as well as the spectacle and interest in prisons due to the fact that handheld stereoscopes themselves were tied to entertainment value. This exhibit is limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for those interested in exploring the complexities surrounding incarceration, that have existed for many years, and persist today.

			<b>Description from Institution:</b> Track 1: John Beecher and members of Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) meet with high school students arrested on charge of criminal syndicalism, and their parents, after their release from jail in McComb, Mississippi. Beecher interviews the group regarding conditions in the jail. The group sings several spirituals. Track 2: Meeting, continued.

			<b>Significance to this exhibit:</b> In this recording, Beecher and members of the Council of Federated Organizations meet with the arrested high school students to discuss the way the charge of "criminal syndicalism" with a $1000 bond was used as a fear tactic to divide the black community in McComb, Mississippi. The first speaker in the recording talks about how "syndicalism" was a contrived charge created in order to arrest an innocent individual. The second speaker, Dennis Sweeney (a white activist) mentions that he was arrested and out of jail in one day and was released without bail, while the black high school students were in jail for a month and had to be bailed out. The third speaker asks about conditions in the prison, and the parents who are present at the discussion talk about the difficulties and restrictions around visiting their arrested children. The arrested students also discuss their experiences. Topics of this recording relate to the affect of imprisonment, wrongful charge and arrest, affect of arrest on friends and family, and the disproportionate impact of arrest on black americans.
