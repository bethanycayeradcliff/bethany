# Issues of Incarceration in the Southern United States: A mini exhibit

## A note on this exhibit: 

I chose the theme of issues of incarceration, especially revolving around wrongful imprisonment. 
It was somewhat of a challenge to find digitized materials related to these topics. I initially 
endeavoured to use only materials related to Texas itself, but broadened that to include materials 
in the southern United States. These materials span in time from the 1860s to the civil rights era, 
to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time. 
I have included materials related to wrongful and forced imprisonment, the affect of imprisonment 
and the death penalty, the history of policing and arrest, as well as the history of the penitientiary 
systems in Texas. This exhibit is quite limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for 
those interested in exploring the complex and problematic effects surrounding incarceration.
