# Issues of Incarceration in the Southern United States: A Mini Exhibit

###### Digital exhibit curated by Bethany Radcliff for INF 385S: Digital Libraries (fall 2020; Professor Melanie Cofield) at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin

### A note on this exhibit: 

I chose the theme of issues of incarceration in the southern United States. It was a challenge to find digitized 
materials related to these topics. I initially endeavored to use only materials related to Texas itself, 
but broadened that to include materials in the southern United States, though most resources have Texas connections. These materials span in time from 1840 to the civil rights era, 
to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time, but are ongoing in temporality.

The items below are from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, Sam Houston State University,
the Texas After Violence Project, which partners with the Human Rights Documentation initiative that UT Libraries currently hosts, and Stephen F. Austin State University. I have included two oral histories from the Texas After Violence Project, to think critically about wrongful imprisonment, lack of fair trial, the impact of imprisonment on formerly incarcerated people, as well as the affect of imprisonment and the death penalty on survivors. The newspaper clipping from Stephen F. Austin's Texas Runaway Slave Project beckons a critical focus on the racist history of policing and arrest. The audio recording on "criminal syndicalism" from the Harry Ransom Center spotlights the creation of false crimes and the wrongful arrest of black Americans. The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State University creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration, as well as the spectacle and interest in prisons due to the fact that handheld stereoscopes themselves were tied to entertainment value. This exhibit is limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for 
those interested in exploring the complexities surrounding incarceration, that have existed for many years, and persist today.

###### This exhibit is based on the Texas Digital Library's [Find Five promotional project](https://www.tdl.org/2020/04/join-find-five/), and the five curated digital works below are from [institutional member groups](https://www.tdl.org/members/) associated with Texas Digital Library.


## Exhibit Items

**1\. ["Criminal Syndicalism" case, McComb, Mississippi](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37)**

![HRC reel case image](/images/HRC-Beecher-audio-image.jpg)

**Collecting Institution:** The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin

**Item Date:** October 19, 1964

**Original Format:** Reel-to-reel audiotapes

**Digital Format:** mp3

**Description from Institution:** 
Track 1: John Beecher and members of Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) meet with high school students arrested on charge of criminal syndicalism, and their parents, after their release from jail in McComb, Mississippi. Beecher interviews the group regarding conditions in the jail. The group sings several spirituals. Track 2: Meeting, continued.

**Significance to this exhibit:**
In this recording, Beecher and members of the Council of Federated Organizations meet with the arrested high school students to discuss the way the charge of "criminal syndicalism" with a $1000 bond was used as a fear tactic to divide the black community in McComb, Mississippi. The first speaker in the recording talks about how "syndicalism" was a contrived charge created in order to arrest an innocent individual. The second speaker, Dennis Sweeney (a white activist) mentions that he was arrested and out of jail in one day and was released without bail, while the black high school students were in jail for a month and had to be bailed out. The third speaker asks about conditions in the prison, and the parents who are present at the discussion talk about the difficulties and restrictions around visiting their arrested children. The arrested students also discuss their experiences. Topics of this recording relate to the affect of imprisonment, wrongful charge and arrest, affect of arrest on friends and family, and the disproportionate impact of arrest on black americans.



**2\. [Stereoscope of front entrance to the Penitentiary](https://digital.library.shsu.edu/digital/collection/p243coll3/id/5607)**

![Sam Houston State Stereoscope Image](/images/SamHouston-steroscopic-prison.jpg)

**Collecting Institution:** Sam Houston State University

**Item Date:** 1873-1875

**Original Format:** stereoscopic photograph

**Digital Format:** jpeg

**Description from Institution:** 	
Stereoscope view of the front entrance to the Texas State Penitentiary before the high wall was built to surround the entire prison property. The large three-story building to the left was erected by Ward, Dewey & Company, lessees, when they took charge. After this building burned, the lot was cleared of debris and the street moved from its then location to sixty or seventy feet further west (over the site of the Superintendent's home, which also was destroyed by the fire). The wall now surrounding the prison was located far enough West to replace what was formerly the street behind and inside the prison walls. That necessitated moving in the entrance gate shown in the photograph to its present location. Before this entrance gate was placed across the street, public passage was open all the way through to the city limits on the east side of town. Ward, Dewey & Co. probably erected the entrance gate and closed the street when they came to Huntsville to operate the Penitentiary.

**Significance to this exhibit:**
The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State University creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration. Handheld steroscopes were popular tools for entertainment in the mid-to-late 1800s and provided intricate and immersive images, [much like present-day virtual reality](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/sterographs-original-virtual-reality-180964771/). Thinking of this history of stereoscopic media can present a way of thinking through the prison and its infrastructure as having an entertainment value, which perhaps contributes to the view of the prisoner as less-than. The focus on the architecture of the prison itself creates a space for thinking about structures of power, and the way the building is presenting in a particular way. The item description also discusses the building of a fence around the prison, further closing the prison away from society.



**3\. [Texas After Violence Project: Interview with Keith Brooks](http://av.lib.utexas.edu/index.php?title=TAVP:Keith_Brooks_1)**

![TAVP Keith Brooks video image](/images/TAVP-Keith-Brooks.png)

**Collecting Institution:** Texas After Violence Project at the University of Texas Libraries 

**Item Date:** February 6, 2013

**Original Format:** Moving image

**Digital Format:** streaming video

**Description from Institution:**
Keith Brooks, a youth minister, small business owner, and native of Fort Worth, Texas, is the second son of Charlie Brooks, Jr., the first man to ever be executed by lethal injection in the United States. In Tape 1, Brooks discusses his experiences growing up in segregated Fort Worth; the gang culture that permeated his neighborhood in the 1970s; memories of his father’s arrest and trial; his experiences with the NAACP; his own time spent in prison; his father’s conversion to Islam; and his own views on the ethics of the death penalty in Texas. In Tape 2, Brooks discusses his experiences with segregation and desegregation of public schools in Fort Worth; his relationship with his family; how his father’s notoriety affected his life and that of his family; his time spent at Texas A&M University and his father’s appeal process. In Tape 3, Brooks discusses the day of his father’s execution, December 7, 1982; his family’s history as sharecroppers in Texas; his experiences as a Black student at Texas A&M; life after his father’s execution; his relationship with Christianity; and the ways in which his father’s legacy has impacted his life and the lives of his family members. This interview took place on February 6, 2013, in the Echo Heights neighborhood of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas.

**Significance to this exhibit:**
Keith Brooks was imprisoned himself, and his father was the first man to ever be executed by lethal injection. The video interviews of Brooks concern his own experiences of imprisonment, experiences with civil rights and segregation, and the memories and experiences he has of his father's imprisonment. Brooks also discusses his views of the ethics of the death penalty and discusses his father's lack of fair trial. 



**4\. [Texas After Violence Project: Interview with Lauren Johnson](http://av.lib.utexas.edu/index.php?title=TAVP:Lauren_Johnson&p=video1&b=0)**

**5\. [Virgil01 (newspaper clipping from Austin City Gazette about fugitve slaves)](https://digital.sfasu.edu/digital/collection/RSP/id/6468/rec/203)**

![SFA image](/images/SFA-runaway-slave-image.jpg)

**Collecting Institution:** East Texas Digital Libraries at Stephen F. Austin State University

**Item Date:** June 3, 1840

**Original Format:** Microfilm of newspaper clipping

**Digital Format:** jpeg

**Description from Institution:** 	
On Friday last, five negroes, the property of Mrs. M. Bullock, and one, the property of Major Samuel Whiting, ran away, carrying off along with them six horses, the property of various individuals; three guns, and, it is supposed about $150 in specie, and $600 or $700 in Texas money. We hope the citizens in all sections of the country, and the commanders and men at the various military posts, will arrest all blacks whom they may find wandering at large through the country without satisfactory passes in their possession. A description of one of the negroes will be seen in our advertising columns of today.

**Significance to this exhibit:**
This newspaper clipping is a listing encouraging the arrest of five enslaved persons who escaped from their owners. This newspaper clipping from 1840 (when Texas was a republic) ties together the current prison-industrial complex to the era of slavery, and shows how policing and incarceration have historically been a racialized method for control of black Americans.
