# Issues of Incarceration in the Southern United States: A Mini Exhibit

###### Digital exhibit curated by Bethany Radcliff for INF 385S: Digital Libraries at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin

### A note on this exhibit: 

I chose the theme of issues of incarceration, especially revolving around wrongful 
imprisonment in the southern United States. It was somewhat of a challenge to find digitized 
materials related to these topics. I initially endeavoured to use only materials related to Texas itself, 
but broadened that to include materials in the southern United States. These materials span in time from the 1860s to the civil rights era, 
to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time. 

The items below are from the Harry Ransom Center at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin, Sam Houston State University,
the Texas After Violence Project, which is part of the University of Texas at Austin Libraries, and Steven F. Austin State University.
I have included materials such as the Texas After Violence oral histories to look think about wrongful imprisonment, as well as the affect of imprisonment and the death penalty on survivors. The newspaper clipping from Stephen F. Austin's Texas Runaway Slave Project beckons a critical focus on the racist history of policing and arrest. The audio recording on "criminal syndicalism" from the Harry Ransom Center spotlights the creation of false crimes and the wrongful arrest of black Americans. The stereoscope image of the Texas State Penitentiary from Sam Houston State creates a space to think about the history and infrastructure of incarceration, as well as the spectacle and interest in prisons due to the fact that stereoscopes presented an entertainment value. This exhibit is limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for 
those interested in exploring the complex and problematic effects surrounding incarceration, that have existed for many years and persist today.

![Sam Houston State Stereoscope Image](/images/SamHouston-steroscopic-prison.jpg)

**Collecting Institution:** Sam Houston State University

**Item Date:** 1873-1875

**Original Format:** stereoscopic photograph

**Digital Format:** jpeg

**Description from Institution:** 	
Stereoscope view of the front entrance to the Texas State Penitentiary before the high wall was built to surround the entire prison property. The large three-story building to the left was erected by Ward, Dewey & Company, lessees, when they took charge. After this building burned, the lot was cleared of debris and the street moved from its then location to sixty or seventy feet further west (over the site of the Superintendent's home, which also was destroyed by the fire). The wall now surrounding the prison was located far enough West to replace what was formerly the street behind and inside the prison walls. That necessitated moving in the entrance gate shown in the photograph to its present location. Before this entrance gate was placed across the street, public passage was open all the way through to the city limits on the east side of town. Ward, Dewey & Co. probably erected the entrance gate and closed the street when they came to Huntsville to operate the Penitentiary.

**Description from Institution:** 	
On Friday last, five negroes, the property of Mrs. M. Bullock, and one, the property of Major Samuel Whiting, ran away, carrying off along with them six horses, the property of various individuals; three guns, and, it is supposed about $150 in specie, and $600 or $700 in Texas money. We hope the citizens in all sections of the country, and the commanders and men at the various military posts, will arrest all blacks whom they may find wandering at large through the country without satisfactory passes in their possession. A description of one of the negroes will be seen in our advertising columns of today.
