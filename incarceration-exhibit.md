# Issues of Incarceration in the Southern United States: A Mini Exhibit

## A note on this exhibit: 

I chose the theme of issues of incarceration, especially revolving around wrongful imprisonment. 
It was somewhat of a challenge to find digitized materials related to these topics. I initially 
endeavoured to use only materials related to Texas itself, but broadened that to include materials 
in the southern United States. These materials span in time from the 1860s to the civil rights era, 
to modern day, in order to show that these are not isolated issues related to a particular time. 
I have included materials related to wrongful and forced imprisonment, the affect of imprisonment 
and the death penalty, the history of policing and arrest, as well as the history of the penitientiary 
systems in Texas. This exhibit is quite limited in nature, but seeks to create a jumping-off point for 
those interested in exploring the complex and problematic effects surrounding incarceration.

Collecting Institution: Sam Houston State University

Item Date: 1873-1875

Original Format: stereoscopic photograph

Digital Format: jpeg

Description from Institution: 	
Stereoscope view of the front entrance to the Texas State Penitentiary before the high wall was built to surround the entire prison property. The large three-story building to the left was erected by Ward, Dewey & Company, lessees, when they took charge. After this building burned, the lot was cleared of debris and the street moved from its then location to sixty or seventy feet further west (over the site of the Superintendent's home, which also was destroyed by the fire). The wall now surrounding the prison was located far enough West to replace what was formerly the street behind and inside the prison walls. That necessitated moving in the entrance gate shown in the photograph to its present location. Before this entrance gate was placed across the street, public passage was open all the way through to the city limits on the east side of town. Ward, Dewey & Co. probably erected the entrance gate and closed the street when they came to Huntsville to operate the Penitentiary.
